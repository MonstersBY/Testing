Dreamless dorm -
Ticking clock,
I walk away -
from the soundless room

Windless night -
Moonlight melts,
My ghostly shadow -
to the lukewarm gloom

Nightly dance...
of bleeding swords...
Reminds me that...
I still live...

I will -
(Burn my bread)
I once ran away from the god of fear
And he chained me to despair-yeah
(Burn my bread)
I will break the chain and run
till I see the sunlight again

I'll lift my face
and run to the sunlight

Voiceless town,
tapping feet,
I clench my fist,
In pockets tight...

Far in mist a tower waits...
Like a merciless tomb,
devouring moonlight...

Clockwork maze -
End unknown,
In frozen time -
A staircase stands

Shadows crawl -
on bloodstained floor,
I rush straight ahead -
with a sword in hands

Cold touch of...
My trembling gun...
I close my eyes...
To hear you breathe...

(Burn my bread)

I will
(Burn my bread)
This time I'll grapple down that god of fear
And throw him into hell's fire
(Burn my bread)
I will shrug the pain and run
till I see the sunlight again

Oh, I will run...
burning all regret and dread...
And I will face the sun -
with pride of the living...
