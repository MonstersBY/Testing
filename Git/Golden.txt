It's a war out there everyday, you can't hide from it
You gotta play by the rules, play it cool
Gotta laugh in the face of the sad disgrace
When your friends and foes look alike

On the face of it
They missed their history
But they fight over place in it
Yeah they fight, over place in it

Hard-hit by the times
That's just how your life goes by
I know it's not your fault, you say
But there ain't no other way

So, step on up to the plate, meet your fate
Walkin' straight on into the lion's lair
Step on up, up to the plate, 'cause this ain't no game
It's time to make history, yeah!
